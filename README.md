# UMS Marketing Project

**_Can we predict the future ticket purchases of UMS customers?_**

The University Musical Society (UMS) has graciously provided us with
**5 years of anonymized purchase data** from concert-goers at the
University of Michigan. From these five years, we have records of
**over 190,000 transactions from 48,000 users**, totalling over **$13M
in revenue.** Our goals are both exploratory (*what patterns and
trends can we discover in ticket purchase data?*), as well as
predictive (*how can we leverage these discoveries to predict future
purchases?*).

This project will kick off near the end of Winter semester and
continue into the Spring and Summer terms.

## Quick-start Guide

### Data

* [Visualization Data](https://umich.box.com/s/00omi84pdu28vm3r5xjlfofy78i353zk)(Requires UM login)
* More data coming soon

Alternatively, run this script to download the visualization data:

```
$ cd data
$ ./download.sh
```

### Exploring the data

From back in the source directory, open the ipython notebook:

```
$ jupyter notebook ums_vis_explore.ipynb
```

## Visualization Challenge

Before we make a prediction challenge out of this data, we have to
figure out what prediction tasks are worth solving. In the first phase
of this project, we will be exploring three out of the five years of
data, with the goal of identifying interesting and challenging
prediction tasks. Similar to past competitions, we'll split into small
groups and explore different aspects of the dataset, and then present
our results in a visualization challenge at our group meeting.

Unlike past competitions, we will be assigning you to teams. Four MDST
veterans have been chosen as Team Captains:

* Jared Webb (`jaredaw`)
* Jonathan Stroud (`stroud`)
* Guangsha Shi (`guangsha`)
* Chengyu Dai (`daich`)

During the kick-off meeting (4/7), each team captain will pitch their
plans for the visualization challenge. Soon after the meeting, we'll
send out a sign-up sheet for you to rank your preferences.

Presentation date: 5/12 (Tentative)
